This tool accesses an online GreenMidget service trained on 4500
examples of public spam messages or track comments that were posted on
SoundCloud. You can use it to classify your texts against it.

  Examples:

  greenmidget 'buy cheap bags online'
  greenmidget 'upload cool tracks online'
  greenmidget potential_spam.txt

Notice: This service is only used as an illustration to the GreenMidget
classifier, however its training is limited and it lacks even basic
features, that GreenMidget could provide.

This is not actually in use at SoundCloud!
